### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**DauntlessAnimus/DauntlessAnimus** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an pplication that will allow users to create a budget that can be adjusted, and that will provide real time feedback on how closely it is being followed.
- â€¢	Project Description
o	The application will be a budgeting application that will allow users to set a budget amount for different categories and keep a running amount at the top of the screen.  The design has been simplified from the original design to help with ease of use.
