Project Outline
•	Project Description
o	The application will be a budgeting application that will allow users to set a budget amount for different categories as well as assign expenses to these categories. The function which will make it unique is that the application will provide a real time estimate of how current expenses align with end of month budget goal.  
•	Problem addressing
o	Current budgeting applications limit the user’s ability to compare how current spending aligns with their end of month budget. Because of unexpected expenses, staying within a budget can sometimes be difficult. Being able to measure the sum of all expenses during the current month against the budgeting goal will better help users determine if they need to pull back on expenses until the end of the budgeting cycle, or if they can afford to make additional expenses.
•	Platform
o	The application will be developed using the latest version of Android (Tiramisu). The application will be available for both Mobile devices and tablets. The application will be developed using Android studio.
•	Front/Back End Support
o	The application will have full front and back end support during the development process. Android studio will be utilized to test and debug before implementation begins.
•	Functionality
o	The application will allow for multiple categories to be added with each category having its own end of month target amount. There will be a dashboard which will show each category, their end of month budget amount, and the current amount which has been spent for that category . There will also be an option to input income, which will make up the total allowable budget amount for the month. New categories can be added for both income and expense categories for the month. The expense amount will have to equal the budget amount so that every dollar is accounted for. 
•	Design 
o	The design will be a very simple design with the following main categories and subcategories:
	Expenses Tab
•	Expense 1
•	Expense 2
•	Etc..
	Income Tab
•	Income 1
•	Income 2
•	Et..
	Add/modify/remove category
	Settings
